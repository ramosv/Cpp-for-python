    There are two types of errors that occur while writing programs: syntax errors and logic errors

    A syntax error is an error that occurs due to typing error or wrong statement that is not allowed in a language. This can be easily caught as the program does not run until this is fixed.

    Logic errors are errors happen not due to error in how the code is written, but because the code is producing an unintended or unexpected value such as a division by 0 leading to an undefined value.

    logic errors can be caught by using try and catch which can help pinpoint what is causing the error and avoid confusion about the problem.
