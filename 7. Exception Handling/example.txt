In this case, the C++ compiler has found that it cannot complete the processing of this instruction since it does not conform to the rules of the language. Syntax errors are usually more frequent when you are first learning a language.
The other type of error, known as a logic error, denotes a situation where the program executes but gives the wrong result. This can be due to an error in the underlying algorithm or an error in your translation of that algorithm. In some cases, logic errors lead to very bad situations such as trying to divide by zero or trying to access an item in a list where the index of the item is outside the bounds of the list. In this case, the logic error leads to a runtime error that causes the program to terminate. These types of runtime errors are typically called exceptions.
